This repository contains CDC Flu challenge predictions that were split out from
https://github.com/reichlab/2016-2017-flu-contest-ensembles to reflect the standard CDC file naming scheme. This was
done to support our forecast repository project. The files came from here, and were renamed according to the standard
(KDE files were already in that format):
- KDE: https://github.com/reichlab/2016-2017-flu-contest-ensembles/tree/master/inst/submissions/kde-files
- kcde, ensemble, and sarima: separate files under https://github.com/reichlab/2016-2017-flu-contest-ensembles/tree/master/inst/submissions/submissions-KoT-stable

Further, we created files needed to be compatible with https://github.com/FluSightNetwork/cdc-flusight-ensemble
`model-id-map.csv` and `metadata.txt`.
